### Homework # 1 Software Practice

This data set is my top 10 favorite tv shows, number of episodes, and the genre. I love movies and tv, and it is what i do in my free time. I thought i would share a little bit of the shows I like to watch! 


```{r}
tv <- read.csv("Best tv shows.csv")
print(tv)
summary(tv)
mean(tv$number.of.episodes)
```
